	  <li> My first impression of this site was confusion. I didn't and still dont know exactly what this site is used for and it feels like unless this site was pitched to you for a specific reason, no one would know what to do when they get on this site. </li>
	  <li> In my opinion, very poorly. There are 3 places to click and all 3 take you to different websites for very very specific things.</li>
	  <li> It confuses me. The name of the website and what is actually on the website seem to be very unrelated. There is a button for how to access the actual website but you have to go through a Domain Backorder which I will not be doing. </li>
	  <li> For what I can see, the graphics are clean and appealing to the eyes.</li>
	  <li> The load time for me was very quick. I didn't feel the need to exit the page and reload it. </li>
	  <li> I think the text size and color make it very readable. The background color, in my opinion, enhances the page simply because I like the color and it doesnt feel like a flashbang when the page is opened. </li>
	  <li> No navigation bar, only buttons to what is called 'Related Searches' and then the link to the Domain Backorder.</li>
	  <li> The background of the page did not change unless you clicked on the backorder button. </li>
	  <li> The site adjusts accordingly to smaller window sizes. The background and front text stay relative in size and margins even when the window gets smaller. </li>
	  <li> To me it was how fast all the links load. Regardless of what you click on it is very fast and takes you to the next page and load that page very quick. </li>
